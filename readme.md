## Car Counting
# How to work ?
In the video, I made a rectangular sensor in the area where the vehicles pass.
When vehicles pass through the red sensor, the sensor turns green.
If the vehicle is large, the heavy vehicle increases by 1.
If the car is small, the car increases by 1.
If the vehicle is passing frequently or if the vehicle is large, the bounding box is red.
If the vehicle is small, the bounding box is blue.
